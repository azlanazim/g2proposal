# Stupendous Sloths Project Proposal - Water Level Monitoring System for Carwash
The Water Level Monitoring System for Carwash is a project aimed at developing an efficient and sustainable solution for monitoring and managing water levels in carwash facilities. With the increasing concern for water conservation and environmental sustainability, it is crucial to implement effective measures to optimize water usage in various industries, including carwashes. This project proposes the implementation of a real-time monitoring system that tracks water levels and provides data-driven insights to enhance water management practices.

# Problem Statement

With the increasing demand for sustainable practices in business, carwash establishments must address the challenges of managing water resources effectively. To this end, we propose the implementation of a water level monitoring system that can provide real-time data on water usage, optimize water consumption, prevent equipment damage, and contribute to environmental sustainability efforts. Our proposal aims to assist car wash businesses in their efforts to reduce costs, increase profitability, and enhance their reputation as responsible corporate citizens.


# System Architecture

The proposed system architecture involves using an ESP8266 microcontroller along with ultrasonic and proximity sensors for water level monitoring and car counting, respectively. The data collected by the sensors is then transmitted to a cloud server using the MQTT protocol via CloudMQTT. The cloud server stores the data in an InfluxDB database, which is accessible through an API built using Django Rest Framework (DRF). Finally, the data is visualized through a dashboard created using Grafana, providing real-time insights into the water usage and carwash traffic. This system architecture offers a complete end-to-end solution for water level monitoring and car counting, enabling businesses to make informed decisions about their water usage and optimize their carwash operations.
