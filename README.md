# System Architecture

The proposed system architecture involves using an ESP8266 microcontroller along with ultrasonic and proximity sensors for water level monitoring and car counting, respectively. The data collected by the sensors is then transmitted to a cloud server using the MQTT protocol via CloudMQTT. The cloud server stores the data in an InfluxDB database, which is accessible through an API built using Django Rest Framework (DRF). Finally, the data is visualized through a dashboard created using Grafana, providing real-time insights into the water usage and carwash traffic. This system architecture offers a complete end-to-end solution for water level monitoring and car counting, enabling businesses to make informed decisions about their water usage and optimize their carwash operations.
